# Crypto-ANN-AlgoTrading

Project Description
This repository contains a comprehensive cryptocurrency trading strategy implemented using Backtrader. The strategy leverages various machine learning algorithms to enhance trading decisions, optimizing for returns while managing risk effectively. The project includes detailed backtesting and performance analysis, utilizing historical market data, and offers a robust framework for both development and production environments.

Key Features
Data Ingestion and Processing: Integration with Binance and Yahoo Finance APIs for historical and real-time data fetching.
Technical Indicators: Implementation of moving averages, volume analysis, and other technical indicators.
Machine Learning Models: Utilization of machine learning models (LSTM, Random Forest, SVM, etc.) for predicting market movements.
Strategy Execution: Customizable trading strategy with adjustable parameters and leverage.
Backtesting: Extensive backtesting capabilities using Backtrader with detailed logging and performance metrics.
Performance Metrics: Calculation of Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, Value at Risk (VaR), and other key performance metrics.
Visualization: Comprehensive visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for analyzing trading performance and model predictions.
Modular Structure: Well-organized project structure for easy maintenance and scalability.
